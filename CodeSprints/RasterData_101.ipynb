Examples could include multiplying a multispectral satelite image by a cloud mask, or multiplying a SAR image by a terrain shadow mask. In this case, the \"masks\" that we're using represent seperate rasters that have been designed to tell us where we expect there to be limited information content in our raster. These \"mask\" layers have values of 1 for each pixel that we want to keep, and a no-data value for all other pixels. When you multiply the raster data by the mask, all the pixels that we want to keep are unchanged (value x 1 = value), and the pixels that we want to discard are converted to no-data (value x no-data = no-data)."
