    "## Part 1: Extract Raster Values at Point Locations in Python\n",
    "#### By Leah Wasser, Chris Holdgraf, Carson Farmer\n",
    "Here, you will extract pixel values that cover each field plot area where trees were measured in the NEON Field Sites. The idea is that you can calculate the mean or max height value for all pixels that fall in each NEON site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you will compare that mean or max height value derived from the lidar data derived canopy height model pixels to height values calculated using human tree height measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you need to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the canopy height model that you wish to extra tree height data from.\n",
    "2. Clean up that data. For instance if there are values of 0 for areas where there are no trees they will impact a mean value calculation. It is better to remove those values from the data.\n",
    "3. Finally you will import and create a buffer zone that represents the area where trees were sampled in each NEON field site.\n",
    "To begin, import your python libraries.\n",
